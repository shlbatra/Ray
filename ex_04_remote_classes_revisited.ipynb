    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray has a myriad of design patterns for [tasks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks/patterns/index.html#task-patterns) and [actors](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors/patterns/index.html). These patterns allows you to write distributed applications. In this tutorial we'll explore one of the design pattern, commonly used in Ray libraries to scale workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree of Actors Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is primarily used in Ray libraries [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html), [Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html), and [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html) to train models in a parallel or conduct distributed HPO.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a tree of actors pattern, a collection of workers as Ray actors (or in some cases Ray tasks too), are managed by a supervisor actor. For example, you want to train multiple models, each of a different ML algorithm, at the same time, while being able to inspect its state during its training. As methology to examine simple baseline models rapidly, this pattern helps machine learning engineers to quickly build a set of baseline models for comparison.\n",

    "|:--|\n",
    "| Common tree actor pattern with a supervisor launching a supervisor actor|\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern facilitates **Same Data Different Function/Model (SDDF)** scaling pattern. Popular in [AutoML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning) scenarios, where you may want to train different models, with their respective algorithms, at the same time using the same dataset.\n",

    "For modularity, we used `model_helper_utils`, where all the model-related utility code is implemented. From all three linear regression models trained in parallel, with the same dataset, XGBoost seems to have faired well with the best MSE result. This gaves us an initial baseline of set of models to further experiment with different [hyperparameter optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization). For that I would turn to [Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html) and [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html), whhich are part of [Ray AIR](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-air/getting-started.html)."

Primarily, the elements remain the same except for few modifications.\n",
